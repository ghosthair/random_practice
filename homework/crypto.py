"""
COMP4722: Network Security
Implement the following functions using the Python secrets and cryptography libraries.
The input and output variables, and expected types are given as comments in each function.

The implementation should thoroughly check for any errors/exceptions that may be generated
during runtime. The functions should never raise an exception of any type other than the
CryptoException class defined below. This way we can ensure that we have considered the
different types of errors/exceptions that can arise in the implementation. Errors can be
malformed input errors, incorrect key sizes, etc. and exceptiopipns can be ones created by your
implementation and also from the used libraries.

All random numbers used in your implementation should be generated using your implemented
generate_random_securely() function
